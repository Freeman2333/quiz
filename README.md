# Quizz App

This is a quiz application that I developed as part of a coding challenge I found on [DOU](https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/front-end-test-tasks-examples/?from=tg&utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social). The app allows users to participate in a quiz, review their answers, and download their results in a CSV format.

You can view the live version of the app here: [quiz-two-kohl.vercel.app](https://quiz-two-kohl.vercel.app).

## Features

- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support implemented with `next-intl`.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI using `Tailwind CSS`.
- **CSV Download**: Users can download their quiz results in CSV format.
- **Accessible UI**: The UI is designed with accessibility in mind.
- **Modern UI Components**: Built with reusable, functional components using React and TypeScript.

The project is built using the following technologies:
